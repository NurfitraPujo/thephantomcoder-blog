Lately, I feel uninspired. I get tired easily when doing my job. My brain went blank when I am on long meeting. 
Works, that usually need only few hours become a matter of days. My personal MTTR went down significantly.
There are many variables that make me feel like this. It is inevitable to be uninspired in our lives. But how can we improve it?

### Go Travel

According to [this](https://neurosciencenews.com/experience-memory-neuroscience-4991/) article shared by Neuroscience News. New experiences, will improve our brains cognitive function.
And how are we supposed to get new experiences? Personally, travelling is one of the best sources of new experiences. Steve Jobs in his teens traveled to India in search of inspiration. 
You don't need to go as far as India thought. Small trips like travelling to your hometown local tourism spot, or local pilgrimage is fine. 

Recently I was forced to take a trip to my close friend wedding invitation. I was pretty frustrated because my works has been piling up and somehow the scope is only getting broader.
Anxious whether I can finish the task before the deadline while I am on travel. But what happened was outside my own expectations. 
Most of my tasks was able to delivered before deadlines and I was able to solve some bugs that I had not solved in the entire week during my travel.
The travel experiences with my close friends give me new experiences and make me feel inspired.

That's why my friend, if you stuck in the slumps, or feeling burnouts or whatever that make you feel uninspired. 
I recommend you to go out of your homes and travel to get new experiences.
